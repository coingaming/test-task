# Test task
Test task for full-stack developer position

Create an application which:

2. Exposes a GraphQL endpoint where Customer can query the following data:
  * all tweets paginated
  * filtered by user
  * filtered by language

Prerequisites:

  * Code should be strictly typed with TypeScript
  * There should not be any database, all data has to be stored in-memory
  * Configuration and security credentials should not be stored in code.
